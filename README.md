# DJDL
I got tired of having to search and get a url to download things using youtube-dl, so this is a simple node script that I can pass in a search term and have it download an audio of the video I want. Maybe one day I'll add a few bells and whistles, but for now it's a quick and dirty version that does what I need it to do.

need to run npm link djdl in case I'm on a new computer and want to link djdl with the terminal/OS
